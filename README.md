For phase1, we have 4 files namely people.py, rooms.py, section.py, timetable.py

people.py is responsible for class definitions of Student, Instructor and Course,
rooms.py is responsible for class definitions of Room and RoomList,
section.py is responsible for class definitions of Section and
timetable.py is responsible for class definitions of Event and Timetable.

There is also demo.py, a command line application to demonstrate phase1.

All files include related methods and some other helper functions, related to the classes that file is responsible for.
